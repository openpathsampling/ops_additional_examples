# Additional Examples for OpenPathSampling

This repository contains additional examples for OpenPathSampling. Originally,
this was to specifically highlight the contributions of the E-CAM project to
OpenPathSampling. That version of the repository is archived at:

https://gitlab.e-cam2020.eu/dwhswenson/ops_additional_examples/

This repository serves as a place to include additional examples and
documentation that are not in the core OpenPathSampling documentation.

These examples can be run interactively using [this Binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/openpathsampling/ops_additional_examples/HEAD).
